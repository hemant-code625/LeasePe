# LeasePe - Peer-to-Peer Item Lending Platform

LeasePe is a web application designed to facilitate peer-to-peer lending among students or hostelers. It allows users to create requests for items they need and connect with others who are willing to lend those items. With real-time updates and geolocation-based filtering, LeasePe makes it easy for users to find and borrow items from their peers.

## Features

- **Request Creation**: Users can create requests for items they need, specifying details such as item description, duration needed, and any other relevant information.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The platform provides real-time updates on requests, ensuring that users can see the latest requests as they are created.

- **Geolocation-Based Filtering**: Requests are filtered based on the user's location, showing only the requests that are nearest to them within a specified range (e.g., 100 meters). This ensures that users see relevant requests based on their proximity.

- **Dynamic Request Lifespan**: Users can set the lifespan of their requests, specifying how long they want their request to remain active on the platform. This feature allows users to adjust the visibility of their requests based on their needs.

- **Chat Functionality** (Cooming Soon): Upon accepting a request, users will be redirected to a chat section where they can communicate with the requester. This feature will facilitate communication between users and without sharing their personal contacts.
